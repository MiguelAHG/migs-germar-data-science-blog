Welcome to my timeline of my data science learning journey. I regularly update this post with new milestones.

# How I started studying data science

I first found out about data science in March 2020, around the time that the COVID-19 pandemic started. I decided to take online courses about data science in the summer, in order to see if it was interesting. First, I took the Python Core, Data Science, and Machine learning courses on [Sololearn](https://sololearn.com).

Here, I learned basic skills in Python, the Spyder IDE, Jupyter Noteboook, SQL basics, and Python packages such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

# Data Science in Practical Research

When school started again in September 2020, I was able to apply my data science skills in my project for Practical Research class. My group's research paper was entitled "The Effect of COVID-19's Consequences on Philippine Frontliners on their Mental Health: A Descriptive, Correlational Study." We collected survey responses from 196 frontliners. I wrote the entire analysis in Python, from data cleaning to transformation to modeling.

I had to learn new things in order to do this, including:

- Statsmodels, a statistical package in Python
- Dummy-coding categorical variables
- Multiple linear regression
- Testing the assumptions of OLS regression
- Interpreting model results

# Dataquest Online Platform

From May 2021 to April 2022, I studied the Data Scientist in Python (DSP) career path on [Dataquest](https://dataquest.io). The courses included many guided projects in Jupyter Notebook, some of which have been posted on my blog.

Read more about what I learned from the DSP path in this [blog post](2022-04-16-Online-Course-Dataquest-Data-Scientist-Python.md).

# 2021 Project SPARTA Butuan City Open Data Challenge

I led a team to participate in this competition from June to November of 2021. I developed agriHanda, an agricultural disaster risk dashboard for Butuan City, Philippines. For this, we won the Second Placer award and Best in Ingenious Solution award.

Read more about this competition in this [blog post](2021-12-17-agriHanda-Agricultural-Disaster-Risk-Web-App.md).

# Data science projects in Grade 12

I made the [Student Mapping Project](2022-05-10-Student-Mapping-Project.md) under the Programming Varsity (ProgVar) in order to help identify students who live in areas affected by natural hazards.

Under the Data Analytics Committee (DAC), I made the [College Applications Dashboard](2022-07-05-College-Applications-Dashboard.md) to visualize the results of a survey about my schoolmates' college choices and the factors influencing them.

# Passion project: Pokemon Team Inspector

To improve my skills in making web apps with interactive visualizations, I made an app that lets you create, edit, and save Pokemon teams, select a specific Pokemon generation whose rules you want to refer to, and analyze your Pokemon individually or as a team.

# Competitions in 2024: Synergy Software Solutions and BlueHacks

This year, I'm an incoming third year in BS Applied Mathematics - Master in Data Science. My team (with five blockmates in our degree program, including myself) participated in Synergy Software Solutions 2024 and Blue Hacks 2024. **We won 1st and 2nd place in these competitions, respectively.**  We had developed a comprehensive personal carbon footprint calculator, as well as a mental health platform for students and guidance counselors.
