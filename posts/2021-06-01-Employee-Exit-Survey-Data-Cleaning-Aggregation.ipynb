Career stage influences an employee's work attitude and virtues that they value in the workplace.\n",

    "In this project, we worked with 2 datasets of employee exit survey data from the DETE and TAFE government institutes in Australia. We cleaned, transformed, and combined these datasets. Then, we analyzed dissatisfaction rates of resignees based on age and based on career stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "We found the following notable points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dissatisfaction rate was highest among resignees in age groups around **26-30 years old and 51-55 years old** for both institutes.\n",
    "- Dissatisfaction rate was highest among resignees who had been working at the institute for **over 7 years**.\n",
    "- The dissatisfaction rate was much **higher among DETE resignees** compared to TAFE resignees. This may have to do with the nature or conditions of the work of DETE employees.\n",
