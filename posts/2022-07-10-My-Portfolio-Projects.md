This post lists my portfolio projects, which are my best original works.

Among the blog posts on my website, many of these are "guided projects," meaning that the data and the research ideas were provided by an online course like Dataquest. Guided projects are only partly original, as I put my own unique twist on them. The portfolio projects showcased below, however, are completely original.

# 2021 Project SPARTA Butuan City Open Data Challenge

I led a team to participate in this competition from June to November of 2021. I cleaned data about the disaster risk of Butuan City's agriculture sector vis-a-vis natural hazards. Then, I developed agriHanda, a dashboard visualizing the data in various forms, such as a colored map of the city, a data summary for each barangay (town), and a custom graphing tool. For this, we won the Second Placer award and Best in Ingenious Solution award, along with a Php 11,500 cash prize and freebies.

Skills used: Python, data cleaning, dashboard development, interactive data visualization, Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

# ASHS Student Mapping Project

In late 2021, I and the officers of the ASHS Programming Varsity (ProgVar) were approached by the school administration with a request to develop an app that would help identify students affected by natural hazards. Thus, I proposed the Student Mapping Project. I set up a database of student locations and developed a web app to be used by the school's student-led disaster risk committee. The app can take a list of affected areas and generate a list of students who live in those areas, as well as a map showing their geographic distribution. This app helps identify which students should be contacted first and given assistance.

Skills used: Python, web app development, data transformation, Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

# ASHS College Applications Dashboard

In my school's Data Analytics Committee (DAC), I made the College Applications Dashboard to create various visualizations of the results of a survey about my schoolmates' college choices and the factors influencing them.

Skills used: Python, dashboard development, interactive data visualization.

# MG Pokemon Team Inspector web app

I made a web app to help Pokemon players evaluate the usefulness of both individual Pokemon and teams of Pokemon. It has a high degree of customization, taking into account each Pokemon's species, move types, and abilities to calculate offensive capacity, defensive capacity, and overall usefulness. Most of the data is ordinal, so it is visualized using color-coded tables and bar charts, with helpful tooltips that can be viewed by hovering over the chart with your cursor. These visualizations were constructed using the Altair data visualization package.

Skills used: Python, web app development, data transformation, interactive data visualization
