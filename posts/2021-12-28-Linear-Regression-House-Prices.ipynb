    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ames, Iowa housing dataset was formed by De Cock in 2011 as a high-quality dataset for regression projects. It contains data on 80 features of 2930 houses. The target variable is the sale price of each house.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to predict the target, I will use linear regression for both statistical inference and machine learning. To each feature (or independent variable), the model will assign a coefficient that shows how the feature affects the target (or dependent variable). I will use the model's $p$ values to determine the features with statistically significant effects, then use these features in our final model for predicting prices from new data."

    "The `coef` column gives the increase in the target for a one-unit increase in the feature (Frost, 2017). For example, the coefficient of `Gr Liv Area` (above-ground living area in square feet) is around 49. Therefore, for every 1 square foot increase in living area, the sale price increases by USD 49.\n",

    "According to UCLA: Statistical Consulting Group (2021), the coefficient of a dummy-coded variable gives the difference between the mean of the target for the level of interest and the mean of the target for the reference level. For example, the coefficient of `Lot Config_CulDSac` is 14,770. Therefore, the price of a house on a cul-de-sac is usually USD 14,770 higher than that of a house on a corner lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `P>|t|` column gives the p value of each feature. A p value less than 0.05 can be considered statistically significant, whereas a p value above that threshold is not. In the case of this model, most of the features are statistically significant.\n",

    "The insignificant features are `Lot Config_FR2` (houses with frontage on 2 sides), `Lot Config_FR3`, and `Bldg Type_TwnhsE` (Townhouse End Units). Though these are not significant, I will keep them in the model because they are necessary components of the dummy-coded categorical variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "According to Frost (2017), VIFs are a measure of **multicollinearity** among independent variables. The lowest possible value is 1, which means no collinearity at all. Values between 1 and 5 show low to moderate multicollinearity, so these are acceptable. However, values over 5 show high multicollinearity and need to be investigated.\n",

    "In the case of this model, all of the VIFs of the features are below 2. The VIF of the constant term is high, but this is not important.\n",

    "The Durbin-Watson test statistic is 1.583. According to Python for Data Science (n.d.), this statistic should ideally be close to 2. If it is below 2, there is positive autocorrelation among the residuals, so one of the assumptions of linear regression is violated. However, as a rule of thumb, values between 1.5 and 2.5 are acceptable. Thus, this statistic is not a cause of concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the Jarque-Bera p value is 0. Because $p < 0.05$, the statistic is significant, so the residuals are not distributed normally. However, Mordkoff (2016) says that according to the Central Limit Theorem, \"as long as the sample is based on 30 or more observations, the sampling distribution of the mean can be safely assumed to be normal.\" Therefore, this is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it for the statistical inference part of this project. Now that I know that my variables are statistically significant, I can make a predictive model and evaluate it."

    "In this last part, I will use scikit-learn to fit a linear regression model for prediction. A 5-fold cross-validation will be used in order to evaluate the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my [recent project](2021-12-21-Predicting-Car-Prices-K-Nearest-Neighbors.ipynb) about the KNN model, I wrote some custom functions that help perform *stratified* cross-validation. This means that the folds are divided such that each fold's target distribution (in this case, price distribution) is similar to that of the full sample. I put the custom functions in this [module](https://github.com/MiguelAHG/mahg-data-science/blob/master/_notebooks/custom_modules/stratified_kfcv.py) for your reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "I performed stratified 5-fold cross-validation on the housing data, so 5 models were fitted and their RMSEs were recorded. The results are shown below."

    "In this project, I cleaned data about houses in Ames, Iowa, selected features that may be useful, interpreted linear regression results to determine significant features, then evaluated a predictive model. I found that the 16 independent variables explained 83.8% of the variance $(R^2 = 0.838, F(16, 2883 = 929.2), p < 0.05)$. Furthermore, the predictive model had a mean RMSE of 31,880, which was decent but not ideal.\n",
